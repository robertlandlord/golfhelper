I like to play golf and analyze my swing using online swing tools. However, my iPhone defaults to .mov extensions and often the videos are too big to load in browser.
This tool helps to:
1. Convert videos to mp4 format
2. Creates a root directory for your videos
3. Saves your videos in a well organized way

## Whats Next on the Roadmap
1. Add option after organizing to directly open up analyzer.
2. Be able to categorize screenshots for comparison into a couple of categories (e.g. upswing/downswing, and then OPTA, shallowing, etc.)
3. Analyze swing automatically against swing of your choice. This needs to be based on camera position, etc. (longer term). Also, based on severity of each issue, rank what things to work on first.
4. Make your analysis sync with Notes or some other app so you know what to work on at the range
