I like to play golf and analyze my swing using online swing tools. However, my iPhone defaults to .mov extensions and often the videos are too big to load in browser.
This tool helps to:
1. Convert videos to mp4 format
2. Creates a root directory for your videos
3. Saves your videos in a well organized way
